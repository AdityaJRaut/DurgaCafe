                    Cafe Durga, is very well known for the best hot and cold coffee in Maharashtra since 2003. The cafe
                    was started by a food enthusiast, Kapil Anil Kulkarni. Though the first outlet was in Kothrud, our
                    family has now extended to as much as 30 franchisees in Pune City alone. Over the years, we have
                    introduced new dishes to the otherwise traditional menu, which has gained tremendous popularity
                    among the young. As a result, we have touched many hearts across Maharashtra. We are proud to serve
                    our loyal foodies with premium services.
